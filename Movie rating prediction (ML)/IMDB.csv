He is a cowboy as raw as his hides. The year is 1925. The Burbank brothers are wealthy ranchers in Montana. At the Red Mill restaurant on their way to market, the brothers meet Rose, the widowed proprietress, and her impressionable son Peter. Phil behaves so cruelly he drives them both to tears, reveling in their hurt and rousing his fellow cowhands to laughter -- all except his brother George, who comforts Rose then returns to marry her. As Phil swings between fury and cunning, his taunting of Rose takes an eerie form -- he hovers at the edges of her vision, whistling a tune she can no longer play. His mockery of her son is more overt, amplified by the cheering of Phil's cowhand disciples. Then Phil appears to take the boy under his wing.

Recently appointed to homicide division, Jensen takes on the job and gives no quarter in her unrelenting pursuit of Pittsburgh's most violent murderers. She'll do whatever it takes to apprehend perpetrators, even if it means overstepping department protocol. Her dedication, however, has a downside, as she often develops an emotional connection to the victims. Forensic psychologist Thomas Schaeffer does as well but in a different way. He teams with Jensen to provide insight into her cases, and the skewed sense of judgment they share becomes both a saving grace and a disruptive, dangerous force. ""Those Who Kill"" is based on the Danish crime series format inspired by the best-selling work of author Elsebeth Egholm."

It dives into relationships with the women he loved who inspired him to compose some of his greatest hits, as well as a huge number of friends he had in the artistic milieu of former Yugoslavia. In addition to Toma, the film will show lives of well-known artists of that time: Zoran Radmilovic, Mika Antic, Tozovac and others. ""Toma"" is a biographical film about Toma Zdravkovic, the man who is remembered not only for his songs and unique way he was singing them, but also as a bohemian, both in his behavior and his soul. The film follows two lines: 1991 -- the relationship between Toma and a doctor who starts Toma's treatment, and how it evolves into a friendship. The second line is about Toma's life: from childhood in Pechenjevci to a friendship with the singer Silvana Armenulic, that will have crucial effect to his career and private life, to the time when he reached undreamed of popularity, but also touched the bottom of life.
